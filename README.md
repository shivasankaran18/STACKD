## üí° Motivation

Every time my team and I participated in a hackathon, we found ourselves spending a significant amount of time setting up the project‚Äôs basic structure‚Äîconfiguring the frontend, backend, database, authentication, and other essential components. The same challenge extends to professionals in the industry, where initial setup can be tedious and time-consuming. To solve this, we created STACKD‚Äîa tool that eliminates repetitive setup tasks, allowing developers to focus on building their applications right away.

## üöÄ Features

- **Flexible Project Setup**: Choose from multiple frontend, backend, database, and authentication options.
- **Automated Configuration**: Generates all necessary files, environment variables, and configurations.
- **Git Integration**: Initializes a Git repository and sets up the remote origin.
- **Pre-configured ORM & Database**: Automatically connects the chosen ORM with the selected database.
- **Instant Deployment Readiness**: Sets up authentication, UI frameworks, and other dependencies for a fully functional project.
- **Multiple Interfaces**: STACKD provides both a **CLI** and a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for easy project setup.
